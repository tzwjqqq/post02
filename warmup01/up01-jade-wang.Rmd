# **Quadratic Equation**
> general form: $ax^2 + by+z=0$

a,b,c are called cofficients.
a can't be zero, or the equation will be linear.

> x=$\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$



# **Comment and reflection**
It's my first time using R Markdown.
It was extremely hard for me at first, but the more I try the more I can understand how to code.
I find relatively easy to code if I'm given some sample solution, but it is somehow hard to code by myself as I don't knnow which function to use.
I thinnk it will be very helpful if we can have a formula sheet including most of the functions we've learned and will use in this class. I think figuring out which function to use is the most time-consuming part for me.
